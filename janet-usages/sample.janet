    # 1) a comment block test has two pieces:
    #
    # 1) the form
    # 2) the expected value comment
    #
    (+ 1 1)
    # => 2

    # 2) another example

    # the following form is executed, as it has no expected value, but its
    # effects will remain valid for subsequent portions
    (def my-value 1)

    # note the use of `my-value` here
    (struct :a my-value :b 2)
    # => {:a 1 :b 2}

    # 3. below shows one way to express nested content more readably
    (let [i 2]
      (deep=
        #
        (struct :a (/ i i)
                :b [i (+ i 1) (+ i 3) (+ i 5)]
                :c {:x (math/pow 2 3)})
        #
        {:a 1
         :b [2 3 5 7]
         :c {:x 8}}))
    # => true

    # 4. one way to express expected values involving tuples, is to use
    #    square bracket tuples...
    (tuple :a :b)
    # => [:a :b]

    # 5. alternatively, quote ordinary tuples in the expected value comment
    (tuple :x :y :z)
    # => '(:x :y :z)

    )

  # this comment block does not have tests because there are
  # no expected values expressed as line comments
  (comment

    (print "hi")

    (each x (range 3)
      (print x))
